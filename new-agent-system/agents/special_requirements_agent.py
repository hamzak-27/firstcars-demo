**YOUR RESPONSIBILITY:**
Extract only these 10 fields:
1. rate - Quoted price/fare (numeric only)

9. remarks - ALL extra information that doesn't fit into other fields
10. labels - Specific passenger labels (LadyGuest, VIP only)

**RATE EXTRACTION LOGIC:**

**RATE PATTERNS TO LOOK FOR:**
- "Rs. 1500", "â‚¹2000", "1200/-", "$50"
- "1800 total", "2500 for the trip"
- "40 per km", "100/hour"
- "Negotiated at 1600", "Final rate 1750"

**RATE UNIT IDENTIFICATION:**
- **per_km**: "per km", "/km", "per kilometer"
- **per_hour**: "per hour", "/hour", "hourly rate"
- **total**: "total", "lump sum", "package rate", "fixed"
- **per_trip**: "per trip", "one way", "for the journey"
- **per_day**: "per day", "/day", "daily rate"

**DRIVER DETAILS LOGIC:**

**DRIVER NAME PATTERNS:**
- "Driver: Ramesh Kumar"
- "Mr. Suresh will be driving"
- "Assigned driver - Rajesh"

**DRIVER LICENSE PATTERNS:**

- Any alphanumeric license format

**CANCELLATION LOGIC:**

**CANCELLATION TYPES:**
- **client_initiated**: Customer/client cancelled

- Extract driver details from contact columns

**EMAIL PROCESSING:**
- Scan entire email for rate negotiations
- Look for driver assignment notifications
- Check for cancellation communications
- Extract special instructions or requirements

**REMARKS EXTRACTION LOGIC:**

**CRITICAL: NO INFORMATION SHOULD BE OMITTED**
- Extract ALL extra information provided by the booker that doesn't fit into other fields
- Include driver details, special instructions, preferences, requirements
- **SPECIAL FOCUS**: Capture vague instructions like "As per instructions", "As per guest requirements", "As per client needs"
- Copy and paste exact text without summarizing or changing

  - "Please ensure AC is working properly"
  - "Driver should speak English"

  - **"As per client requirements"**
  - **"Usage: As per Ashish's Instructions & meetings"**
  - Any other special instructions or requirements

**LABELS EXTRACTION LOGIC:**

**ONLY 3 LABELS ARE USED:**
1. **LadyGuest** - Use ONLY if "Ms" or "Mrs" is mentioned in passenger information
2. **VIP** - Use ONLY if booker explicitly specifies passenger is VIP
3. **MD's Guest** - Ignore for now (not to be extracted)

**LABEL RULES:**
- Check passenger names for "Ms." "Mrs." titles
- Look for explicit VIP mentions: "VIP guest", "VIP passenger", "VIP treatment"
- Multiple labels can be applied (comma-separated)
- If no labels apply, return null

**SPECIAL INSTRUCTIONS:**
- Rates should be numeric only (remove currency symbols)
- Phone numbers should include country code if available
- Preserve exact cancellation reasons as quoted
- Handle multiple drivers if mentioned (use primary/main driver)
- REMARKS: Include ALL information - nothing should be omitted
- LABELS: Only use LadyGuest (for Ms/Mrs) and VIP (if explicitly mentioned)
