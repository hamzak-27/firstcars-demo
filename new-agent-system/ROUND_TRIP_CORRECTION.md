# ✅ **ROUND TRIP LOGIC - CORRECTED**

## 🎯 **You Were Right - Same City for Round Trips!**

I initially misunderstood the round trip logic. You correctly pointed out that for round trips, **both `from_location` and `to_location` should have the same city names**.

## 🔄 **CORRECTED Round Trip Logic**

### **For Your Example:**
```
Type of duty: Travel to Aurangabad and same day back
Reporting place: Airoli bus depot, near railway station, Navi Mumbai
```

### **Correct Extraction:**
```json
{
    "from_location": "Mumbai",
    "to_location": "Mumbai"    // ✅ SAME city for round trips
}
```

### **NOT:**
```json
{
    "from_location": "Mumbai", 
    "to_location": "Aurangabad"   // ❌ WRONG - This was my mistake
}
```

## 🛠️ **Updated Agent Logic:**

### **Location Time Agent Prompt:**
```python
**ROUND TRIP LOGIC:**
⚠️ **SPECIAL CASE:** For round trips (A to B back to A):
- When duty mentions "and same day back", "and return", etc. this indicates a round trip!
- For round trips, BOTH from_location AND to_location should be the SAME BASE CITY
- Example: "Mumbai to Aurangabad and same day back" → from: "Mumbai", to: "Mumbai"
- Example: "Travel to Aurangabad and same day back" (from Navi Mumbai) → from: "Mumbai", to: "Mumbai"
```

### **Key Round Trip Patterns:**
- ✅ **"Travel to Aurangabad and same day back"** → `from: "Mumbai", to: "Mumbai"`
- ✅ **"Mumbai to Pune and return"** → `from: "Mumbai", to: "Mumbai"`  
- ✅ **"Round trip to Delhi"** (from Mumbai) → `from: "Mumbai", to: "Mumbai"`
- ✅ **"Delhi outstation and back"** → `from: "Mumbai", to: "Mumbai"`

## 📊 **Expected Results for Your Table:**

### **Your Booking Table:**
```
Type of duty: Travel to Aurangabad and same day back
Reporting place: Navi Mumbai
```

### **Correct Output:**
```csv
from_location,to_location,duty_type
"Mumbai","Mumbai","Outstation"
```

**Explanation:** 
- Even though the travel is "to Aurangabad", it's a **round trip**
- The system shows the **base city** (Mumbai) for both from/to columns
- The intermediate destination (Aurangabad) is handled in the travel details/remarks

---

## 🎯 **Why This Makes Sense:**

1. **Billing Perspective**: Customer is billed from their base city (Mumbai)
2. **Logistics**: Car starts and ends at the same location (Mumbai)
3. **Route Type**: It's classified as a Mumbai-based service, not city-to-city transfer
4. **Consistency**: All round trips follow same pattern regardless of intermediate stops
