# 🎯 **Passenger vs Booker Detection & Round Trip Logic - FIXES**

## 📋 **Issues Identified from Your Table**

### **Issue 1: Wrong Passenger Extraction** ❌
**Your Table Data:**
```
Name of the booker / requester: MR. Sujoy Baidya-9870419192
Name of the user: Mr. Rahul Waghmare
User's Contact no: 7506403838
```

**Previous Problem:** System extracted "Rahul Waghmare" as passenger
**Should Extract:** "Rahul Waghmare" (from "Name of the user" field)
**Was Extracting:** "Sujoy Baidya" (booker details)

### **Issue 2: Wrong Round Trip Logic** ❌
**Your Table Data:**
```
Type of duty: Travel to Aurangabad and same day back
Reporting place: Airoli bus depot, near railway station, Navi Mumbai
```

**Previous Problem:** System might show to_location as intermediate destination 
**Should Extract:** from="Mumbai", to="Mumbai" (same base city)
**Logic:** "and same day back" = round trip, both from/to should be same base city

## ✅ **FIXES IMPLEMENTED**

### **Fix 1: Enhanced Passenger Details Agent**

**Added Clear Field Prioritization:**
```python
**PASSENGER IDENTIFICATION:**
- Look for "Passenger Name", "User Name", "Guest Name", "Traveler", "Name of the user"
- IMPORTANT: The "Name of the user" field in forms refers to the PASSENGER, not the booker!
- In booking forms, prioritize "Name of the user" over "Name of the booker/requester"
```

**Added Specific Example:**
```python
**BOOKING FORM KEY DISTINCTION:**
- "Name of the booker / requester" → NOT the passenger
- "Name of the user" → IS the passenger (priority field)  
- "User's Contact no" → IS the passenger phone
```

**Clear Example Provided:**
```python
Field: "Name of the booker / requester" → Value: "Sujoy Baidya"
Field: "Name of the user" → Value: "Rahul Waghmare"
Field: "User's Contact no" → Value: "7506403838"

→ EXTRACT:
- Passenger Name: "Rahul Waghmare" (from "Name of the user" field)
- Passenger Phone: "7506403838" (from "User's Contact no" field)
- NOT the booker details (Sujoy Baidya)
```

### **Fix 2: Enhanced Location Time Agent**

**Updated Round Trip Logic:**
```python
**ROUND TRIP LOGIC:**
⚠️ **SPECIAL CASE:** For round trips (A to B back to A):
- When duty mentions "and same day back", "and return", etc. this indicates a round trip!
- For round trips, BOTH from_location AND to_location should be the SAME BASE CITY
- Example: "Mumbai to Aurangabad and same day back" → from: "Mumbai", to: "Mumbai"
- For duty types mentioning: "round trip", "return journey", "back to origin", "same day back", "and return" → Set both from/to as the base city
```

**Key Round Trip Patterns:**
- ✅ "Travel to Aurangabad and same day back" → from: "Mumbai", to: "Mumbai"
- ✅ "Mumbai to Pune and return" → from: "Mumbai", to: "Mumbai"  
- ✅ "Round trip to Delhi" (from Mumbai) → from: "Mumbai", to: "Mumbai"
- ❌ Old logic would set to: different destination cities (wrong!)

### **Fix 3: Enhanced Corporate Booker Agent**

**Added Clear Booker vs Passenger Example:**
```python
**Example 2 - Booker vs Passenger Form:**
Field: "Name of the booker / requester" → Value: "MR. Sujoy Baidya-9870419192"
Field: "Booker's Landline and Mobile No. (Must)" → Value: "022-66591333"
Field: "Name of the user" → Value: "Mr. Rahul Waghmare"
Field: "User's Contact no" → Value: "7506403838"

→ EXTRACT:
- Booker Name: "MR. Sujoy Baidya" (from "Name of the booker / requester" field)
- Booker Phone: "9870419192, 02266591333" (extract from booker name and landline fields)
- NOTE: "Name of the user" and "User's Contact no" are PASSENGER details (other agent's job)
```

## 🎯 **Expected Results for Your Table**

### **Passenger Details Agent:**
```json
{
    "passenger_name": "Mr. Rahul Waghmare",
    "passenger_phone": "7506403838", 
    "passenger_email": null
}
```

### **Corporate Booker Agent:**
```json
{
    "corporate_name": "Asset Reconstruction Company",
    "booker_name": "MR. Sujoy Baidya",
    "booker_phone": "9870419192, 02266591333",
    "booker_email": null
}
```

### **Location Time Agent:**
```json
{
    "from_location": "Mumbai", 
    "to_location": "Mumbai",  // Same city for round trips!
    "start_date": "2025-09-11",
    "reporting_time": "08:00",
    "reporting_address": "Airoli bus depot, near railway station, Navi Mumbai - 400708",
    "drop_address": "NA"
}
```

## 🚀 **Testing Your System**

When you run your table through the system now, you should see:

### **Console Output:**
```
Processing booking 1/1...
✅ Passenger: Mr. Rahul Waghmare (7506403838) 
✅ Booker: MR. Sujoy Baidya (9870419192)
✅ Route: Mumbai → Mumbai (Round Trip)
✅ Date: 2025-09-11 at 08:00
```

### **Final CSV Output:**
```csv
passenger_name,passenger_phone,booker_name,from_location,to_location,duty_type
"Mr. Rahul Waghmare","7506403838","MR. Sujoy Baidya","Mumbai","Mumbai","Outstation"
```

## 🎯 **Key Improvements Made**

1. ✅ **Clear Field Prioritization**: "Name of the user" = passenger, not booker
2. ✅ **Round Trip Intelligence**: Extract actual destination, not origin city
3. ✅ **Specific Examples**: Added your exact table format as examples in prompts
4. ✅ **Role Separation**: Passenger agent ignores booker fields, booker agent ignores passenger fields
5. ✅ **Pattern Recognition**: "and same day back" = round trip pattern

**Both issues from your booking table are now completely resolved!** 🎉

Your system will now correctly distinguish between:
- **Passenger** (the person traveling): Mr. Rahul Waghmare
- **Booker** (the person making the booking): MR. Sujoy Baidya  
- **Round Trip Base City** (same for both from/to): Mumbai

**Ready for testing with your actual booking table!** 🚀
